# APCSA-Java-Projects


During APCSA, I completed multiple projects that helped me gain a deeper understanding of of the language.

## Snowstorm Lab
This lab was a basic object exercise to help better understand classes, constructors, and methods for creating objects.

## Hawaiian Words
When the user inputs a word, the program determines whether the word is a valid Hawaiian word, and if so, it prints the pronunciation. In this project I utilized a variety of string methods and 2D arrays to translate the words.

## Rocketship
This program prints a rocketship that is scalable to any size input. During this project, I developed a greater understanding of the behavior of for-loops within for-loops.

## Symmetric Difference


## Wordle
I coded a wordle game that allows the user to guess words, keep track of used letters, and see correct letter placement from previous guesses. The program uses 2D arrays, loops, and other logic to create an easy and fun playing experience.

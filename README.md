# APCSA-Java-Projects


During APCSA, I completed multiple projects that helped me gain a deeper understanding of of the language.

## Hawaiian Words
When the user inputs a word, the program determines whether the word is a valid Hawaiian word, and if so, it prints the pronunciation. In this project I utilized a variety of string methods and 2D arrays to translate the words.

## Rocketship
This program prints a rocketship that is scalable to any size input. During this project, I developed a greater understanding of the behavior of for-loops within for-loops.
